====== REQUIREMENTS ======

Building GParts requires the following packages:

    gcc
    libgtk2.0-dev
    pkg-config

Additionally, GParts requires a database for the back-end.  Currently, GParts
can use either MySQL or PostgreSQL.  In order to use MySQL, the packages listed
below must be installed.  The mysql-server package may not be required if
configured to use a remote server.

    libmysqlclient15-dev
    mysql-client
    mysql-server

In order to use PostgreSQL, the following packages must be installed:
(TODO: PostgreSQL not supported yet.)

    libpq-dev
    postgresql

In order to use SQLite, the following packages must be installed:

| sqlite3       | A command line interface for SQLite 3 | Required |
| sqlite3-0     | SQLite 3 shared library               | Required |
| sqlite3-0-dbg | SQLite 3 debugging symbols            | Optional |
| sqlite3-dev   | SQLite 3 development files            | Required |
| sqlite3-doc   | SQLite 3 documentation                | Optional |

Of course, installing all packages before building allows the application to
use either database for the back-end.

====== BUILDING GPARTS ======

In the top directory of the source package, execute the following commands.

    $ ./autogen

    $ ./configure

    $ make

    $ make gparts-mysql.la
    $ make gparts-sqlite.la

    $ sudo make install

The parts manager needs to know the location of system-gafrc file. The parts
manager will search for this file, but often cannot locate it. Providing the
following enviroment variable provides better results.

    $ GEDADATADIR=
    $ export GEDADATADIR

Similarly, the parts manager must also locate the system-gpartsrc file. Until
the implementation improves, the location must be specified in an environment
variable.

    $ GPARTSDATADIR=
    $ export GPARTSDATADIR

    $ gparts

====== DATABASE CREATION ======


===== MySQL =====

Install MySQL.

    Tested under 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.1.

To create the database, enter MySQL command line mode as root and enter the SQL
commands below.  Placing the password in the command line could leave the
password in the command line history.  Using only the -p option will cause
mysql to prompt for the password and avoid this situation.  A different
database name, other than gparts, can be specified by the user.  Using
different names, the user can create multiple GPart databases.  Additionally,
user accounts may need to be created.

    $ mysql -u root -p

    mysql> create database GParts;
    mysql> use GParts;
    mysql> grant all privileges on *.* to 'user'@'localhost'
           identified by 'password';

After creating the database, the base tables and part-specific tables must be
created.  All the SQL commands to perform these operations are included in the
distributed files.  Enter the following commands at the MySQL command line.

    mysql> source sql/mysql/create-basic.sql
    mysql> source sql/mysql/create-categories.sql
    mysql> source sql/mysql/create-discretes.sql
    mysql> source sql/mysql/create-passives.sql

Begin loading the database, starting with package data.  The package data must
be loaded before any parts.

    mysql> source data/packages.sql

The package includes a tool to parse the symbol libraries and generate an
SQL file for import into the database.  Run the tool at the shell prompt, then
import the file from an MySQL prompt.  The tool requires the root gEDA
directory as the only parameter. Your gEDA root directory may be different than
below.  The symbol data must be loaded before any parts.

    $ tools/symbols.py /usr/share/gEDA >tmp/symbols.sql

    mysql> source tmp/symbols.sql

The package includes a script to generate some sample part data.  Similar to
the symbol tool, run the script at the shell prompt, then import the data at
the MySQL prompt.

    $ data/parts-bourns.py >tmp/parts-bourns.sql

    mysql> source tmp/parts-bourns.sql


===== PostgreSQL =====

TODO: Finish implementation

===== SQLite =====

The source package contains a sample database in the location below. This
database can be opened from directly within the parts manager.

    gparts/sql/sqlite/sample.db

If required, use the following command line to create a new database or recreate
the sample database. In this example, the present working directory must be
gparts/sql/sqlite.

    $ sqlite3 sample.db

After creating the database, read base and part specific tables into the
database.

    sqlite> .read create-basic.sql
    sqlite> .read create-categories.sql
    sqlite> .read create-discretes.sql
    sqlite> .read create-passives.sql

Read sample packages into the database. Because SQLite does not implement stored
procedures, a special version of this file resides in the gparts/sql/sqlite
directory.

    sqlite> .read packages.sql

Read sample symbols into the database.

    sqlite> .read symbols.sql

And finally, exit the command line interface.

    sqlite> .exit
